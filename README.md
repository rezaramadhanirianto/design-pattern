# Design Pattern
My learning for design pattern

## Creation Pattern

### Singleton
Singleton only have one instance in application and must provide global access to get instance of the class. Singleton design pattern example <code>java.lang.Runtime</code>.

### Factory
The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.

### Abstract
Same function as factory pattern but the difference is how we check subclass, in abstract we have subclasses factory respectively.

### Builder
