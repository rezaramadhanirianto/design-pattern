/**
 *  Suppose we have a list of Radio channels and the client program want to traverse through them one by one or based on the type of channel.
 *  For example some client programs are only interested in English channels and want to process only them,
 *  they don’t want to process other types of channels.
 *  So we can provide a collection of channels to the client and let them write the logic to traverse through the channels and decide whether to process them.
 *  But this solution has lots of issues such as client has to come up with the logic for traversal. We can’t make sure that client logic is correct.
 *  Furthermore if the number of client grows then it will become very hard to maintain.
